/* Error Name and Error Message

  the first and simplest part of describing an error is to name it

  the name and message for an error are logged at the top in your console
  - name will be the same in all browsers
  - messages may change depending on which browser you are in

  your errors will probably say Uncaught, you can ignore that for now

  go ahead and fill in the "name" and "message fields in your error description"
