/* Different Browsers

  when all goes well, the main browsers will interpret your code (mostly) the same way (chrome/ium, firefox, edge)
  but when something goes wrong, they may report the error differently

  the examples in this chapter were all written using Chrome
  if you are using a different browser and get a slightly different message or line number
    it can still be correct!

  when describing your errors (for yourself, a classmate, a coach, on stackoverflow, ... )
    you should mention which browser you were using.

  This becomes even more important as you move through HYF and encounter more advanced JS

  you can now fill out this field of the error description:
