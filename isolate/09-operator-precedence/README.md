## Operator Precedence

In JavaScript you will come across long operations written on one line. This code will become less mysterious when you understand how Operator Precedence works in JS.

The following examples and exercises will help you internalize JS operator precedence, learning to read a long expression and see it as a series of single steps will change your programming life!

In these exercises you will study strange and meaningless expressions, they will use all the primitive types and do all sorts of ugly coercions. Keep in mind that none of this is good habits! The goal of these exercises is to practice understanding difficult JavaScript expressions so when you come across them in the wild you know what to do.
